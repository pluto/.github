Pluto is a set of developer tools that makes applied cryptography accessible to developers across the world. 

Our first tools help developers incorporate Web Proofs into their applications. Web Proofs are a new type of zero-knowledge proof that enable verifiable access to Web2 data sources.

For more information on Pluto, see our [documentation](https://docs.pluto.xyz), [website](https://pluto.xyz), or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plutolabs_).


## Web Proofs 

The Web Proofs SDK consists of three main components:
1. Pluto CLI
2. Pluto web SDK
3. Pluto mobile SDK

Developers can generate Web Proofs on demand using our SDK/CLI. At launch, this platform supports proofs for OAuth signatures, JSON Web tokens, Venmo transaction history, Reddit posting history, and Amazon purchase history.

## Main repositories

- [Ronkathon](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon): Educational project for learning about applied cryptography; a Rust implementation of a collection of cryptographic primitives.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to our open-source projects. If you want to contribute or follow along with contributor discussions, join our [main Telegram channel](https://t.me/pluto_xyz/1) to chat about Pluto's development.

Our contributor guidelines can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). A good starting point is issues labelled 'bounty' in our repositories.

For now, we're inviting collaborators to participate in [Ronkathon](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon) educational project. In the coming weeks, we will be open-sourcing other core product repositories, which will also have open issues for contributors.
